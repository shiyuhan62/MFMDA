#MFMDA
MFMDA is a novel calculation method that uses matrix factorization algorithm to identify potential related miRNAs of known or new diseases. The method is implemented in Matlab2014a.

description:
"Main.m" shows the experimental results of MFMDA on HMDD V2.0.
"MFMDA.m" is a function of the MFMDA algorithm.
"RoCcompute.m" realizes the function of calculating AUC and AUPR values, and realizing ROC and PR curves.
"B1.mat, Km.mat, Kd.mat" respectively represent the pre-processed known correlation matrix and the similarity matrix between miRNAs and diseases.
